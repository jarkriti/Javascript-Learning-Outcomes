1) Syntax Parser:

A programm called as compiler converts source code written in Javascript to a machine understandable language.
It reads code line by line and check if there are any syntax errors according to its code.
This programm that checks syntax is called as syntax parser.

2) Lexical Environment

This means where where something physically sits in your code i.e. inside which function or is it present globally. 
Few things are determined by the position of your variables and functions inside a code.

3) Execution Context

A wrapper to help manage the code that is running. The lexical environment that is currently running is defined by execution context.

4) Name/Value pairs and Objects

Name that maps to unique value. A name can only have one value in a given execution context.
Value can be more name/value pairs.

Ex. Address = "77N Almaden Ave"

Object is collection of name value pairs.

5) Global Environment and global object

Anything written outside of all the functions, comes under global execution context.
Execution context has global object and a special variable called 'this'.
